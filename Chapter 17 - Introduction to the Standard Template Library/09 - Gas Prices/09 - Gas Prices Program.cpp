//9. Gas Prices
//
//In the student sample program files for this chapter, you will find a text file
//named GasPrices.txt. The file contains the weekly average prices for a gallon of gas in the U.S,
//beginning on April 5, 1993 and ending on August 26, 2013. Figure 17-10 shows an
//example of the first few lines of the file's contents.
//
//Each line in the file contains the average price for a gallon of gas on a specific
//date. Each line is formatted in the following way:
//
//	MM-DD-YYYY:Price
//
//MM is the two-digit month, DD is the two-digit day, and YYYY is the four-digit
//year. Price is the average price per gallon of gas on the specified date.
//
//For this assignment, you are write one or more programs that read the contents
//of the file and perform the following calculations:
//
//Average Price Per Year: Calculate the average price of gas per year, for each
//year in the file. (The file's data starts in April of 1993, and it ends in August
//2013. Use the data that is present for the years 1993 and 2013.)
//
//Average Price Per Month: Calculate the average price for each month in the file.
//
//Highest and Lowest Prices Per Year: For each year in the file, determine the date
//and amount for the lowest price, and the highest price.
//
//List of Prices, Lowest to Highest: Generate a text file that lists the dates and
//prices, sorted from the lowest price to the highest.
//
//List of Prices, Highest to Lowest: Generate a text file that lists the dates and
//prices, sorted from the highest price to the lowest.
