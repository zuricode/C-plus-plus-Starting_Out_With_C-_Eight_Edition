//Write a program that uses the following arrays :
//
//• empId : an array of seven long integers to hold employee identification numbers.The
//array should be initialized with the following numbers :
//5658845 4520125 7895122 8777541
//8451277 1302850 7580489
//• hours : an array of seven integers to hold the number of hours worked by each
//employee
//• payRate : an array of seven double s to hold each employee’s hourly pay rate
//• wages : an array of seven double s to hold each employee’s gross wages
//
//The program should relate the data in each array through the subscripts.For example,
//the number in element 0 of the hours array should be the number of hours worked by

//18-10. Payroll Modification
//
//Modify Programming Challenge 9 in Chapter 7 (Payroll) to use three linked lists instead of
//three arrays to hold the employee IDs, hours worked, and wages. When the program starts,
//it should ask the user to enter the employee IDs. There should be no limit on the number of
//IDs the user can enter.
