//20. Patient Fees
//
//1. This program should be designed and written by a team of students.Here are some
//suggestions :
//
//– One or more students may work on a single class.
//– The requirements of the program should be analyzed so each student is given
//about the same workload.
//– The parameters and return types of each function and class member function
//should be decided in advance.
//– The program will be best implemented as a multi - file program.
//
//2. You are to write a program that computes a patient’s bill for a hospital stay.The
//
//The PatientAccount class
//The Surgery class
//The Pharmacy class
//The main program
//
//– The PatientAccount class will keep a total of the patient’s charges.It will also
//keep track of the number of days spent in the hospital.The group must decide
//on the hospital’s daily rate.
//– The Surgery class will have stored within it the charges for at least five types
//of surgery.It can update the charges variable of the PatientAccount class.
//– The Pharmacy class will have stored within it the price of at least five types of
//medication.It can update the charges variable of the PatientAccount class.
//– The student who designs the main program will design a menu that allows the
//user to enter a type of surgeryand a type of medication, and check the patient
//out of the hospital.When the patient checks out, the total charges should be
//displayed.
