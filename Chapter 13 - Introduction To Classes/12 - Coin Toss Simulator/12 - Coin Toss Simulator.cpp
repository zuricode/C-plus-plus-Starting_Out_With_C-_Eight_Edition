//12. Coin Toss Simulator
//
//Write a class named Coin.The Coin class should have the following member variable :
//
//� A string named sideUp.The sideUp member variable will hold either �heads� or
//�tails� indicating the side of the coin that is facing up.
//
//The Coin class should have the following member functions :
//
//� A default constructor that randomly determines the side of the coin that is facing up
//(�heads� or �tails�) and initializes the sideUp member variable accordingly.
//� A void member function named toss that simulates the tossing of the coin.When
//the toss member function is called, it randomly determines the side of the coin that
//is facing up(�heads� or �tails�) and sets the sideUp member variable accordingly.
//� A member function named getSideUp that returns the value of the sideUp member
//variable.
//
//Write a program that demonstrates the Coin class.The program should create an
//instance of the classand display the side that is initially facing up.Then, use a loop
//to toss the coin 20 times.Each time the coin is tossed, display the side that is facing
//up.The program should keep count of the number of times heads is facing upand the
//number of times tails is facing up, and display those values after the loop finishes.
